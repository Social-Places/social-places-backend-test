## Step 3 - Completion
### Submission
1. Submit the work in your repository to [Orestes Sebele](orestes@socialplaces.io)
2. Wait for feedback - ETA 5 ~ 7 business days

We'd like to state the test is focused on character and less on being accurate, while being accurate is important, integrity and being teachable are core principals
There is no single correct answer, and should we select you for another interview be prepared to discuss your decisions and ideas when coding
